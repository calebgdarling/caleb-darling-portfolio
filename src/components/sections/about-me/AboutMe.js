          Hi, I'm Caleb Darling, an aspiring software developer based out of the Twin Cities. I enjoy working on both front-end and back-end development, and I'm
          always eager to learn and explore new tools and frameworks to enhance
          my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time you can catch me walking my Australian Shepherd Banjo or improving my Tennis serve! Feel free to reach out; my contact info is listed below.
